# Lab 2

This lab builds upon the concepts covered in lab 1, focusing on utilizing the command line 
for various Git operations such as repository management, initialization, and status checks. 
Through this lab, I gained proficiency in executing Git commands and memorized them, 
which proved beneficial throughout the course.
